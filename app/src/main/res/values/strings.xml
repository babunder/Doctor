    <string name="ayurveda_data">Ayurveda texts described in detail the plastic surgery of nose and a novel way of treatment of fistula of the anus . These treatments are accepted by surgeons today .\n
Ayurveda thinks of treatment of illnesses before they arise and before a baby is born .\n
In many diseases such as acidity e jaundice , skin diseases like psoriasis, arthritis ayurved can be of great help.\n
Persons of different temperament according to Ayurveda would need different lifestyle in in different climatic conditions . If we follow this advice in addition to whichever medicine that we are taking we can get better relief in many troubles</string>

It works like magic in many conditions and gives relief which is long lasting . It is of great use in conditions for example recurring common cold , premenstrual syndrome , anal fissure, fistula ,

Probe tenderness in right elia fossa doesn\'t necessarily mean appendicitis. \n
Sonography of the uterus and ovaries :\n
If menses are not heavy or there is no severe pain, small swelling of the uterus and ovaries are usually no reason for operation.\n
Coronary Angiography :\n
Finding of a blocked vessel does not necessarily mean that angioplasty or byepass surgery are necessary.\n
Double and triple marker studies in pregnancy.\n
These must be done if the mother is more than 35 years of age or there is history of a child with a problem right from the birth. \n
If the sonography at 11 to 13 weeks of pregnancy is abnormal, then this test might be necessary. However, if this sonography is normal it is unlikely that the test will truly detect an abnormal pregnancy.\n
If  done routinely a test result can be abnormal in presence of a normal pregnancy and costly and somewhat dangerous tests would be necessary\n
